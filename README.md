Climate Change Trend Analysis Using Time-Series Data
Overview

This project demonstrates time-series analysis of synthetic climate indicators, including global temperature anomalies, CO₂ concentration, and sea level rise. Using decomposition, visualization, and ARIMA forecasting, it explores long-term climate change patterns and provides insights into potential future trends.

Features

Synthetic dataset generation with >100 monthly data points (2000–2019).

Visualization of climate indicators.

Seasonal decomposition of temperature anomaly.

ARIMA forecasting model for trend prediction.

Evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE).

Dataset

The dataset is synthetic and generated within the code. It contains:

temperature_anomaly (°C)

co2_concentration (ppm)

sea_level_rise (cm)

Saved as climate_change_time_series.csv or Excel file if needed.

Requirements

Install the required Python libraries:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib statsmodels scikit-learn

Usage

Run the analysis:

python climate_change_trend_analysis.py


This will:

Generate synthetic climate data.

Save it as a CSV file.

Plot trends and seasonal patterns.

Forecast temperature anomalies using ARIMA.

Results

Visual plots of synthetic climate indicators.

Seasonal decomposition of temperature anomalies.

ARIMA forecast with accuracy metrics (MAE & RMSE).

Applications

This project is a learning tool for:

Time-series analysis and forecasting.

Climate science and sustainability studies.

Data visualization and trend detection.
